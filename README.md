# YelpCamp
A full fledged website made by me, while learning from the Udemy course 'The Web Developer Bootcamp'

## About
This website enables users to post camping locations along with it's details and cost, and also add comments on different posts. However, the users need to be 'logged in' to post and comment, or else they'll only be able to view the website, not interact with it. Flash messages are availible to guide or notify a user about his/her interactions. The website has CRUD functionality, and routing is done by 'Restful Routing Convention'

## User Authentication Features
- Without login, user can only view the website
- After sign up and login, user can post and comment
- Only the author of a post can edit the post
- Only the author of a comment can edit the comment
- Author gains superior control over his post and can delete any comment that is unfriendly
- There cannot be 2 same usernames for different users
- Sign out option availible

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (Passport js - user authentication)
- Node
- Express
- MongoDb

## More
There are many more features that can still be added to this website, so I'll be using this as project as a workspace to try out new features and learn to implement them for further use
